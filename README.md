## Live example

View a [sample folder](http://larsjung.de/h5ai/sample)  
*(the files are all empty to save webspace)*


## Install

Everything you need is located in folder `target`.

* Copy folder `h5ai` to the web-root directory of your server or alternativly set an alias `/h5ai/` to
  this folder.
* Add the content of file `dot.htaccess` to the `.htaccess` file inside the directory you want to be
  styled (you might have to create this file). This directory and any subdirectories will be styled by h5ai.
* Adjust `options.js` inside the `h5ai` folder to your needs. Defaults will be fine for a start.

Optionally add `h5ai.header.html` and/or `h5ai.footer.html` files to any of the styled folders to [display
custom top or bottom sections](http://larsjung.de/h5ai/sample/customize). The content of those files
will be wrapped by `<header>` and `<footer>` tags.
